=>XML (eXtensible Markup Language)


eXtensible = Extend our notation
Makeup = Write using Markup
Language = Create your own  document

XML is not all the same HTML.But both are Markup Language
XML is to describe the data. HTML is used to display the data
XML must define custom rules(tags) . HTML has pre-define rules(tags)


describe = XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is 
display = HTML was designed to display data and focus on how data look

eg.element 
<markup>Something Here</markup>

eg.attrutube
<markup title="info">Something Here</markup>
